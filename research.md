## Research Focus

Reinforcement learning for pursuit-evasion and search problems under
partial observability, noisy sensing, and constrained decision spaces.\
Applications include UAV-assisted sensing, autonomous search strategies,
and grid-based policy learning under uncertainty.

## Master's Thesis

**[Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Pursuit of a Ground Target in a
Grid with Local and Erroneous
Information](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/ws/send_file/send?accession=ucin1712917978519522&disposition=inline)**\
University of Cincinnati · 2024

Developed deep reinforcement learning strategies for pursuit-evasion in
grid environments with partial and erroneous local information.\
Analyzed policy robustness under sensor noise and evaluated convergence
stability across discrete decision models.
