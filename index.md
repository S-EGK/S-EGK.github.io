## Srikanth Elkoori Ghantala Karnam
Robotics / Autonomy / Perception / Edge ML.

## About Me
I’m a Robotics Engineer focused on autonomy and embedded AI deployment. I design and ship end-to-end robotic systems — from simulation and reinforcement learning research to real-time perception pipelines optimized on NVIDIA Jetson platforms. My work spans ROS 2 autonomy stacks, multi-robot systems, and decision-making under uncertainty. I care about systems that move from theory to reliable field deployment. I build deployable robotics systems end-to-end: perception → localization → planning/control → hardware integration,
with a focus on **embedded deployment**, **real-time performance**, and **reliable field behavior**.

## Currently
- Lead Robotics Engineer (Stokes Robotics) — simulation, autonomy integration, and embedded perception deployment.
